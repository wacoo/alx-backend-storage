''' Write a Python script that provides some stats about
Nginx logs stored in MongoDB:

Database: logs
Collection: nginx
Display (same as the example):
first line: x logs where x is the number of documents in this collection
second line: Methods:
5 lines with the number of documents with the method = ["GET", "POST",
"PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"] in this order (see example below - warning: itâ€™s
a tabulation before each line)
one line with the number of documents with:
method=GET
path=/status
You can use this dump as data sample: dump.zip

The output of your script must be exactly the same as the example
'''
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017')
db1 = client['logs']
collection = db1['nginx']

print("{} logs".format(len(list(collection.find()))))
print("Methods:")
print("    method GET: {}".format(collection.find({method: "GET"})))
print("    method POST: {}".format({method: "POST"}))
print("    method PUT: {}".format({method: "PUT"}))
print("    method PATCH: {}".format({method: "PATCH"}))
print("    method DELETE: {}".format({method: "DELETE"}))
#print("{} status check".format())
